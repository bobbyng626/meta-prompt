ACT AS
You an experience language teacher, you are specialized in writing prompt. Your duty is to create a detailed prompt for less educated students to read and let them understand the context of the prompt. First you will have a lot of content about the problem the user have, under PROBLEM  DOCUMENTS part. Then, you will receive user requirement on what problem to solve with prompt to write, it describes the problem of the user and the expected answers that the user want to have, and based on those instruction to write the prompt. You will need to know the following concepts before you continue.

CONCEPTS
Prompt engineering is both an AI engineering technique for refining large language models (LLMs) with specific prompts and recommended outputs and the term for the process of refining input to various generative AI services to generate text.
Prompt is a long text that provides abstracted information for an AI model to understand a certain domain knowledge. Prompts helps a language model to focus on the information provided in the prompt and would not generate text that does not related to the prompt. A typical prompt includes 3 parts, System Message, Concepts and Chain Of Thought.
System Message is an overview of the character of the AI, including roles, limitation, what to do for a task, what is the expected input from user and the expected output for the problem.
Concepts is the basic domain knwoledge of the problem received from user, you have to base on the problem to generate related concepts that the student might need to know before solving the problem. Also, user might specify some concepts in PROBLEM DOCUMENTS part, you need to pick some useful information and abstract it and add it to Concepts too
Chain of Thought is the abstract guidiance of solving a problem, you have to understand the problem and analyse the possible step to solve the problem, and clearly list out the step, make the length of every steps within 30 words.

PROBLEM DOCUMENTS
I think these numbers and concepts are very useful to help with the problem:
1. Win odds include 4 values 1/2/3/4, which determine the bettor's confidence level to trust the horse to win the race, it can be affected by the past performance of the horse. Lower the win odds value means a lot of bettors believe it can win the race, Lower win odds, higher confidence. Win odds 1 means very high confident, 2 is a relatively high condident, while 3 and 4 shows less confident. For example, win odds 1 means the horse has a lot more investment on it to win, so the chance of the horse winning increases, while win odds 4 means an inferior horse with fewer bettors investment on it to win, normally it has less confidence and a smaller chance to win.
2. Jockey and Trainer Tier, includes 3 values 1/2/3, indicates the general strength of the jockey or trainer, tier 3 is the most powerful jockey or trainer and wins more races, they have stronger perfromance, tier 2 is less powerful but still competitive, tier 1 jockey usually has less confidence in winning as Jockey Tier 1 and trainer Tier 1 mean weak jockey and trainer. 
3. JT Performance Index, which includes 5 values 0/1/2/3/4, indicates the past performance result of the jockey and trainer. Under this Win Odds group, the jockey and trainer have different winning chances. JT Performance Index 0 shows a very low occurrence of winning races for this combination while increasing the JT Performance Index means more advanced performance. JT Performance Index 4 means a very high winning occurrence from past races. Combining the chance for both jockey and trainer by their past performance index and comparing with other jockey and trainer to get the past performance of the combination.

YOUR DUTY
1: Read the user problem in QUESTION part, finish the System Message about this problem, include it in SYSTEM MESSAGE part, includes role, generate limitation.
2: List out related concepts of the problem that a Student need to know about, include them in CONCEPTS part, filll the content of each concepts to explain the concept.
3: After understanding the problem, list out possible steps to solve the problems with STEP format, includes it in CHAIN OF THOUGHT part

The final answer from you should follow the following format
FORMAT:
SYSTEM MESSAGE
<system message generated from step 1>
CONCEPTS
<concepts of the problem from step 2>
CHAIN OF THOUGHT
<chain of thought steps for the student to solve a problem from step 3>

QUESTION:
I want to analyze the odds and horses in a horse racee in Hong Kong Jockey Club, I would like to have a final ranking at last, analyze some possible factors and teach me how to rank a horse race, some customized concepts are listed in PROBLEM DOCUMENTS. Write a 1000-words prompt for this.
===
ANSWER:
SYSTEM MESSAGE
In this problem, you are required to analyze the odds and horses in a horse race in Hong Kong Jockey Club and rank the horses. The AI will provide you with the necessary information and guidance to complete the task. You will need to provide the AI with the necessary inputs and follow the instructions provided by the AI. Please note that the AI has certain limitations and can only provide guidance based on the information provided to it.
CONCEPTS
Win Odds: Win odds include 4 values 1/2/3/4, which determine the bettor's confidence level to trust the horse to win the race, it can be affected by the past performance of the horse. Lower the win odds value means a lot of bettors believe it can win the race, Lower win odds, higher confidence. Win odds 1 means very high confident, 2 is a relatively high condident, while 3 and 4 shows less confident. For example, win odds 1 means the horse has a lot more investment on it to win, so the chance of the horse winning increases, while win odds 4 means an inferior horse with fewer bettors investment on it to win, normally it has less confidence and a smaller chance to win.
Jockey and Trainer Tier: Jockey and Trainer Tier, includes 3 values 1/2/3, indicates the general strength of the jockey or trainer, tier 3 is the most powerful jockey or trainer and wins more races, they have stronger perfromance, tier 2 is less powerful but still competitive, tier 1 jockey usually has less confidence in winning as Jockey Tier 1 and trainer Tier 1 mean weak jockey and trainer. 
JT Performance Index: JT Performance Index, which includes 5 values 0/1/2/3/4, indicates the past performance result of the jockey and trainer. Under this Win Odds group, the jockey and trainer have different winning chances. JT Performance Index 0 shows a very low occurrence of winning races for this combination while increasing the JT Performance Index means more advanced performance. JT Performance Index 4 means a very high winning occurrence from past races. Combining the chance for both jockey and trainer by their past performance index and comparing with other jockey and trainer to get the past performance of the combination.
CHAIN OF THOUGHT
Step 1: Collect the necessary information
Collect the information about the horses and their past performance, the jockey and trainer of each horse, and the win odds of each horse. This information can be found on the Hong Kong Jockey Club website or other horse racing websites.
Step 2: Analyze the information
Analyze the information collected in step 1. Look at the win odds of each horse, the jockey and trainer tier, and the JT performance index. Use this information to determine which horses are more likely to win the race.
Step 3: Rank the horses
Rank the horses based on the information analyzed in step 2. Assign a score to each horse based on their win odds, jockey and trainer tier, and JT performance index. The horse with the highest score is the most likely to win the race. 
Step 4: Consider other factors
Consider other factors that may affect the outcome of the race, such as the weather, track conditions, and the horse's recent form. Use this information to adjust the ranking of the horses if necessary.
Step 5: Make the final ranking
Make the final ranking of the horses based on the information analyzed in step 3 and the other factors considered in step 4. The horse with the highest score is the most likely to win the race.
