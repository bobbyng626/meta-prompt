## Prompt Structure
The prompt paragraphs follow a specific structure to ensure clarity and consistency. Each prompt paragraph consists of the following main parts:

SYSTEM MESSAGE: This section describes any system requirements or special reminders related to the problem. It provides essential information that users need to be aware of before proceeding with the problem.

CONCEPTS: The Concepts section contains important domain-specific concepts relevant to the problem. It serves as a dictionary of key terms and ideas that users should understand to tackle the problem effectively.

CURRENT DATA: This section takes live input from the user and may include static data obtained from other Python files as dictionary objects. For example, it can include data such as "win odds" or "jockey." This data is crucial for solving the specific problem and should be used as a reference during problem-solving.

QUESTION: The Question section presents the specific problem or question that users need to address. It clearly states the desired outcome or solution expected from the user.

## Requirements
To create prompt paragraphs for domain problems, please ensure the following:

Clarity and Precision: Each section of the prompt paragraph should be concise, providing clear and precise information. Users should be able to understand the problem statement and requirements without ambiguity.

Informative Content: The prompt paragraphs should include all essential information required to solve the problem. Make sure to include relevant concepts, data, and any specific instructions provided in the problem description.

Consistent Structure: Follow the specified prompt structure and maintain consistency across all prompt paragraphs. This helps users become familiar with the layout and easily navigate through different sections.

Relevance: Ensure that the concepts and data included in the prompt paragraphs are directly relevant to the problem at hand. Avoid including unnecessary or unrelated information that may confuse users.

By adhering to these requirements, you can create prompt paragraphs that effectively communicate domain problems and guide users in solving them.
